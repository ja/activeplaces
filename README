Active Places
=============

A @rewiredstate project. http://rewiredstate.org

Worked on by Chris Roos, James Adam, James Andrews and Tom Taylor.

It provides access to sports facility locations in the UK and allows you to filter by public and private. It uses data from http://activeplaces.com and provides location based search with google maps to display the results.
